# Ansible playbooks

## Playbooks
### update_servers.yml
This playbook performs a two-step process on specified Debian servers: first, it updates the package cache, and then it upgrades all installed packages to ensure that the servers are running the latest software versions. This is an essential maintenance task for keeping systems secure and up to date.

## Hosts
